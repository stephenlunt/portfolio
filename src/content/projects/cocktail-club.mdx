The Cocktail Club is a Flask web application I created to form my final project
submission for <ExternalLink href="https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science" text="CS50s Introduction to Computer Science" />.
It is simply a website for discovering cocktail recipes.

Some features of the site include: searching for cocktails by name or ingredient,
user login and registration, and liking, disliking and favouriting cocktails.

As my first full-stack software project, I used this opportunity to gain
experience working with an external public API (I chose <ExternalLink href="https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php" text="TheCocktailDB" />).
I could then focus on building a user interface to display data fetched from the API.
