This is a small tool for generating and checking the strength of passwords.
It is run as a command line script and written in Python.

Its two main features are:

- generating strong, unique, and randomised password
- checking the strength of a password based on criteria such as length, letter
  case, number usage, and special characters.

This project was created as part of my submission for <ExternalLink href="https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-introduction-programming-python" text="CS50s Programming with Python course" /> and
was an opportunity to practice using Python classes and test-driven
development with the <ExternalLink href="https://pytest.org/" text="pytest" /> framework.
