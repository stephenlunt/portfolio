Word Checker (<ExternalLink href="https://wordchecker.io" text="wordchecker.io" />) is
an online word-finding tool I built for Scrabble players to learn more about Scrabble and
words from the dictionary.

It primarily runs the Django framework on the backend which handles most of the application
logic server side. Vanilla JavaScript is used on the frontend to add interactivity for users.
Finally, Docker is used to containerise the Django application, including the Postgres
database, nginx proxy, and Redis cache, which makes for easy deployment.
