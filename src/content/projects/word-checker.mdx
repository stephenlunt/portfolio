Word Checker (<ExternalLink href="https://wordchecker.io" text="wordchecker.io" />) is an online word-finding website I built for Scrabble players. It's a collection of word tools such as dictionary checkers and word finders, coupled with a personal blog about word games.

The app is primarily built using the Astro framework hosted on Cloudflare pages. Some server-side rendering is used, but most pages are statically rendered for performance. Additionally, React was used alongside Astro to add interactivity to some components.

The app's backend is a dockerised Go application connected to a Postgres database and Redis cache. This serves as a REST API for the dictionary of words used in Scrabble and a service for word tools such as word finders and anagram solvers.
