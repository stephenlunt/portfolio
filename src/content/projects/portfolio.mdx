My portfolio (the site you're on now) was built using <ExternalLink href="https://astro.build/" text="Astro" /> and
is available to view at the <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/stephenlunt/portfolio" text="GitHub repo here" />.

On top of Astro, it utilises <ExternalLink href="https://react.dev/" text="React" /> to create interactive UI components
and <ExternalLink href="https://tailwindcss.com/" text="TailwindCSS" /> for styling. Blog posts are written in
Markdown format through Astro's content collections.

This project was recently rebuilt, migrating from the Next.js framework to Astro. This was primarily because
I felt Astro was better suited to my use case. But also just to try something new after having used Next.js
for projects in the past.
